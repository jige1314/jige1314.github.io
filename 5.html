	<p>This is a pretty high tech website but it has many bugs, for example it's way too slow, a 14 second video takes 7 minutes to upload and to download let alone it still has to genrate you a video that actually matches with the text. The music it uases is also really weird and some of the pages with barely any words lasts for like 10 seconds and it takes again 7 minutes to upload.</p>
