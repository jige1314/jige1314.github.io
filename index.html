	<h1>Introduction</h1>
To introduce myself, I am <a href="1.html">*****</a> , a 12 years old girl at ***** bilingual school. Here are the <a href="information.html">basic information</a> about me that you may wanna know.
	
<p>One of my hobbies are drawing. I like drawing alot, it's an interesting activity that i would recommed to anyone and everyone. Drawing is a good way of releasing stress, when you are frustrated you may wanna take out a pen and draw anything you wnt, or even just doodle around on a piece of paper. Drawing is also not that bad for your eyes. If you have nothing to do and your parednt don't let you play games, then i strongly recommend you go get a paper and scribble freely on it.</p>
