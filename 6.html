	<p>A bracket, as used in British English, is either of two tall fore- or back-facing punctuation marks commonly used to isolate a segment of text or data from its surroundings. Typically deployed in symmetric pairs, an individual bracket may be identified as a 'left' or 'right' bracket or, alternatively, an "opening bracket" or "closing bracket", respectively, depending on the directionality of the context.</p>
	<p>Angle brackets or chevrons ⟨ ⟩ were the earliest type of bracket to appear in written English. Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus coined the term lunula to refer to the round brackets or parentheses ( ) recalling the shape of the crescent moon (Latin: luna).[3]

Most typewriters only had the left and right parenthesis. Square brackets appeared with some teleprinters.

Braces (curly brackets) first became part of a character set with the 8-bit code of the IBM 7030 Stretch.[4]

In 1961, ASCII contained parenthesis, square, and curly brackets, and also less-than and greater-than signs that could be used as angle brackets.</p>
	<p>In English, typographers mostly prefer not to set brackets in italics, even when the enclosed text is italic.[5] However, in other languages like German, if brackets enclose text in italics, they are usually also set in italics.[6]</p>
